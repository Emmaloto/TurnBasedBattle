BETA Test v 1.4

Welcome to Emmanuel's hilariously simple turn-based battle game! 

You control the text characters on the left with the button  
choices down below. Here you can see what each of the buttons do!
	  
   - HEAL:       This heals your character for about 100-150 hp.
   
   - TRASH TALK: You make a snarky comment for 50 - 200 damage. 
                  He's gonna need some ice for that burn!  
                  
   - ATTACK:     Normal attack that deals 50 - 200 damage.	  
   
   - SPECIAL:    SPECIAL attack (obviously) that deals 100 - 400 damage.
   
   - DANCE:      Does 0 damage. Seriously. However there is a 10% chance
                 of awesomeness happening! Are you willing to risk it?

  Press h to hide this menu again and Esc to exit the game.
  
  I've been able to add original & free art to the game, as well as a few UI 
  customization options, like changing the background or changing the fish design. 
  You can try them out by accessing the menu bar at the top.
 
  This game is just a fun little pet project of mine. You can check out some of 
  my other work at my website in the "File" menu options.
