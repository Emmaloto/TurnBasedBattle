BETA Test v 1.4

Welcome to Emmanuel's hilariously simple turn-based battle game! 

You control the text characters on the left with the button  
choices down below. Here you can see what each of the buttons do!
	  
   - HEAL:       This heals your character for about 100-150 hp.
   
   - TRASH TALK: You make a snarky comment for 50 - 200 damage. 
                  He's gonna need some ice for that burn!  
                  
   - ATTACK:     Normal attack that deals 50 - 200 damage.	  
   
   - SPECIAL:    SPECIAL attack (obviously) that deals 100 - 400 damage.
   
   - DANCE:      Does 0 damage. Seriously. However there is a 10% chance
                 of awesomeness happening! Are you willing to risk it?

  Press the Replay button at the top to replay this game
  Press h to hide this menu again and Esc to exit the game.
  
    In previous versions of the game, I actually had an armored character, 
  but the art did not belong to me, so I had to replace it with this text instead.
  I'm hoping to get in touch with an artist who can make some original art.
  If you are one who is interested, please shoot me an e-mail!
    
  As you can probably see, there is a lot of work to be done on the graphics, 
  and new functions to be added.
  E-mail me at icyblaze16@gmail.com to send in your info! Any constructive criticism
  is greatly appreciated!!!
