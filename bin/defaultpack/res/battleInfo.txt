BETA Test v 1.2

Welcome to Emmanuel's hilariously simple turn-based battle game! 

You control the armored character on the left with the button  
choices down below. Here you can see what each of the buttons do!
	  
   - HEAL:       This heals your character for about 100-150 hp.
   
   - TRASH TALK: You make a snarky comment for 50 - 200 damage. 
                  He's gonna need some ice for that burn!  
                  
   - ATTACK:     Normal attack that deals 50 - 200 damage.	  
   
   - SPECIAL:    SPECIAL attack (obviously) that deals 100 - 400 damage.
   
   - DANCE:      Does 0 damage. Seriously. However there is a 10% chance
                 of awesomeness happening! Are you willing to risk it?

  Note: This is a beta test. I cannot publish this because I am using copyright art
  so please do NOT post this anywhere or distribute it. I would like info on bugs,
  things that are not working right, and general improvements. This is a very 
  rough version, so do not expect too much.
  There is a lot of work to be done on the graphics, and new functions to be added.
  E-mail me at icyblaze16@gmail.com to send in your info! Any constructive criticism
  is greatly appreciated!!!
